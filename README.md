ArmetOS
---

A WIP cloud aware hardened operating system based on the latest [Fedora](https://getfedora.org/).   
In the future this will probably be split into two flavors: one based atop of [CentOS Atomic Host](https://wiki.centos.org/SpecialInterestGroup/Atomic/Download/) and one atop 
of [Fedora Atomic Host](https://getfedora.org/atomic/download/).

[Soggy-Sock](https://github.com/cloudflavor/ArmetOS/releases) is the first working version and at this
point is nothing else but a fedora image with `cloud-init` installed.

ArmetOS aims to be secure by being [CIS compliant](https://www.cisecurity.org/cybersecurity-best-practices/).
